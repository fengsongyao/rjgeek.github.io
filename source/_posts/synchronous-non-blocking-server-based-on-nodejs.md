> The old blocking multi-threaded server architecture always encounter the limitations of performance when faced of these problems such as large data, long connection, high concurrent requests, Nodejs change the maximum number of connections to the flow of a single system to solve the bottleneck.This article aims to explore the difference between asynchronous non-blocking server and blocking multi-threaded server from work and running performance.then explains the superiority of Nodejs in processing large data, long connection, high concurrent requests.
